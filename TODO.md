## CODE

-   consider maps instead of objects in some cases
-   consider adding conditionalRendering function, for form, menu, etc
-   use useRef instead of document.methods
-   try to split states into smaller states (form doesn't need to set fields in state, just mutate the global obj and render, the separate form state will get changes from the itemObj state)
-   think about adding ID to workObj(allows making render function more geniric)

-   add DnD
-   tailwind
-   create css components
