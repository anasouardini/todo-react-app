# FullStack Todo App

This was my first react project, just like learning new things, I've
learned a ton about react as a library and ecosystem.
It's not something to be proud of, but it was a stepping stone for
makind these two: [Snipshare](https://github.com/segfaulty1/snipshare) and [SmartTeam](https://github.com/segfaulty1/smartTeam).

It was a step up from a pure JS project. I inroduced react just like
that, thinking it'll just work, but the structure of the project was
not compatible, so I spend a lot of time debugging, then I understood
why big project do not jut switch technologies like that.

## Tools
### Common
1. Webpack

### Front-End
2. React-router
3. Sass (This one only made harder to style things)
4. React-icons (very cool piece of tech)

### Back-End
1. prisma (I didn't need this one, it made thing take so long to run)
2. express.js
3. helmet
