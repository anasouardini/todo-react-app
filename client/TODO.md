## CODE

-   post pone this
-   use useRef instead of dom manipulation methods
-   try to split state into smaller states (the separate form state will get changes from the itemObj state)

-   tailwindcss
-   create css components

-   github sync(links that takes you to exact piece of code you wanna change, etc)
-   sync with other 3rd-parties(teams, stack, )

### brain storms (not sure about this)

-   make templates customizable by variables
